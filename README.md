# Machine Learning Baby Monitor Sleep Schedule
### What is it?
Convolutional neural network trained to track our infantâ€™s sleep schedule using our Google Nest camera.
This project is wrapped in a Flask web app to provide:
- Live video feed
- Live prediction from the neural network
- UI for classifying new training data
- Interactive plots for exploring the various models I've tried
